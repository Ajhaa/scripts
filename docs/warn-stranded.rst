warn-stranded
=============

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Reports citizens that are stranded and can't reach any other unit
    :tags: fort units

If any (live) units are stranded the game will pause and you'll get a warning dialog telling you
which units are isolated. This gives you a chance to rescue them before
they get overly stressed or start starving.

You can enable ``warn-stranded`` notifications in `gui/control-panel` on the "Maintenance" tab.
