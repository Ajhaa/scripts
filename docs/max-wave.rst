Limit the number of migrants that can arrive in the next wave by
overriding the population cap value from data/init/d_init.txt.
Use with the `repeat` command to set a rolling immigration limit.

If you edit the population caps using `gui/settings-manager` after
running this script, your population caps will be reset and you may
get more migrants than you expected.
