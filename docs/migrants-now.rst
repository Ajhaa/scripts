.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Trigger a migrant wave.
    :tags: fort armok units

This tool can trigger an immediate migrant wave. Note that it only works after
at least one wave of migrants have arrived naturally, and that no migrants are
actually guaranteed to arrive (especially if you've just run this command a few
times).
