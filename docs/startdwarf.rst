startdwarf
==========

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Increase the number of dwarves you embark with.
    :tags: unavailable embark fort armok

You must use this tool before embarking (e.g. at the site selection screen or
any time before) to change the number of dwarves you embark with from the
default of 7.

Note that the game requires that you embark with no fewer than 7 dwarves, so
this tool can only increase the starting dwarf count, not decrease it.

Usage
-----

::

    startdwarf <number>

Examples
--------

``startdwarf 10``
    Start with a few more warm bodies to help you get started.
``startdwarf 500``
    Start with a teeming army of dwarves (leading to immediate food shortage and
    FPS issues).
