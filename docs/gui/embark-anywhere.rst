gui/embark-anywhere
===================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Embark wherever you want.
    :tags: embark armok interface

If you run this command when you're choosing a site for embark, you can bypass
any warnings the game gives you about potential embark locations. Want to
embark in an inaccessible location on top of a mountain range? Go for it! Want
to try a brief existence in the middle of the ocean? Nobody can stop you! Want
to tempt fate by embarking *inside of* a necromancer tower? !!FUN!!

Any and all consequences of embarking in strange locations are up to you to
handle (possibly with other `armok <armok-tag-index>` tools).

Usage
-----

::

    gui/embark-anywhere

The command will only work when you are on the screen where you can choose your
embark site.
