============

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Quickly run saved commands.
    :tags: dfhack

This tool lets you keep a list of commands that you use often enough to not want
to type it every time, but not often enough to be bothered to find a free
keybinding. You can edit and save the commands from the UI.

Also see `gui/launcher`, whose history search functionality allows you to run
commands from your command history quickly and easily.
