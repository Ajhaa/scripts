This tool provides a spawning interface for units, trees, and/or items. Units can be created with arbitrary skillsets, and trees can be created either as saplings or as fully grown (depending on the age you set).

You can choose whether spawned units are:

- hostile (default)
- independent/wild
- friendly
- citizens/pets
