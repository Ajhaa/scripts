    :summary: Create units, trees, liquids, snow, and mud.
    :tags: fort armok animals map plants units

This tool brings up the arena creation interface while you're in fort mode. You
can create units (with arbitrary skillsets) and trees, spawn liquids, and paint
the ground with snow or mud. You can also use this tool to clean the map of
spatters (like snow, mud, or blood). Note that the weather controls do not have
an effect on your fort.

You can choose whether spawned units are:

- hostile (default)
- independent/wild
- friendly
- citizens/pets

See `clean` for other ways to clean the map of spatters and `gui/liquids` for a
more focused interface for creating liquids.
