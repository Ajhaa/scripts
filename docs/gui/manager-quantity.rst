gui/manager-quantity
====================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Set the quantity of the selected manager workorder.
    :tags: untested fort workorders

There is no way in the base DF game to change the quantity for an existing
manager workorder. Select a workorder on the j-m or u-m screens and run this
tool to set a new total requested quantity. The number of items remaining in the
workorder will be modified accordingly.
