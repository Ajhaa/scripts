This tool provides a graphical interface for creating trees.

Place the cursor wherever you want the tree to appear before you run the script.

Then, select the desired tree type from the list, and then the age. If you just
hit :kbd:`Enter` for the age, it will default to 1 (the youngest age for a
non-sapling tree).

For full-grown trees, try an age of 100.
