devel/find-offsets
==================

.. dfhack-tool::
    :summary: Find memory offsets of DF data structures.
    :tags: untested dev

.. warning::

    THIS SCRIPT IS STRICTLY FOR DFHACK DEVELOPERS.

    Running this script on a new DF version will NOT MAKE IT RUN CORRECTLY if
    any data structures changed, thus possibly leading to CRASHES AND/OR
    PERMANENT SAVE CORRUPTION.

To find the first few globals, you must run this script immediately after
loading the game, WITHOUT first loading a world. The rest expect a loaded save,
not a fresh embark. Finding ``current_weather`` requires a special save
previously processed with `devel/prepare-save` on a DF version with working
DFHack.

The script expects vanilla game configuration, without any custom tilesets or
init file changes. Never unpause the game unless instructed. When done, quit the
game without saving using `die`.

Usage
-----

::

    devel/find-offsets all|<global names> [nofeed] [nozoom]

- global names to force finding them
- ``all`` to force all globals
- ``nofeed`` to block automated fake input searches
- ``nozoom`` to disable neighboring object heuristics
